DESCRIPTION="Generic ebuild which satisifies virtual/chromeos-bsp.
This is a direct dependency of virtual/target-chromium-os, but is expected
to be overridden in an overlay for each specialized board.  A typical
non-generic implementation will install any board-specific configuration
files and drivers which are not suitable for inclusion in a generic board
overlay."
